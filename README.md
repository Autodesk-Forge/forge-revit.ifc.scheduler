## Description

This code sample demonstrates the usage of Model Derivative API, which allows you to convert a Revit `.rvt` file stored in BIM 360 Docs to `.ifc` format.

The [IFC file format](https://technical.buildingsmart.org/standards/ifc/) is a common transfer format used throughout the world, and consumed by a wide range of applications. You can use this tool to automate tasks to convert Revit Files hosted in BIM 360 Docs to IFC on a recurring basis.

Users choose either folders or specific files, then choose an IFC Settings Set name, and set a schedule on which the folders or files should be converted to IFC. At the scheduled time,  the application creates [model derivative](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/model-derivative/v2/developers_guide/overview/) jobs for each file, and uploads the IFC file into the same folder as the original Revit file. If the Revit file and IFC Settings Set name have not changed since the last conversion, no job will be created.

**Note.** [Model Derivate API](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/model-derivative/v2/developers_guide/overview/) incurs cost. To view the current cost of the Model Derivative service, and to purchase Cloud Credits for file conversions, please view the [Forge Pricing page](https://forge.autodesk.com/pricing#cloud-credits).

### Running locally

Clone this project or download it. It's recommended to install [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). To clone it via command line, use the following (**Terminal** on MacOSX/Linux, **Git Shell** on Windows):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Autodesk-Forge/forge-revit.ifc.scheduler.git
```

* **Visual Studio** (Windows):

    Open the project [RevitToIfcScheduler.csproj](RevitToIfcScheduler.csproj), find [appsettings.template.json](appsettings.template.json) in the solution window, copy and rename it to `appsettings.Development.json`.

![Visual Studio](.readme/visualStudioSettings.png "Visual Studio")

* **Visual Studio Code** (Windows, MacOS):

    Open the folder, at the bottom-right, select **Yes** and **Restore**. This restores the packages (e.g. Autodesk.Forge) and creates the launch.json file.

    Afterward, find [appsettings.template.json](appsettings.template.json) in the explore window, copy and rename it to `appsettings.Development.json`.

![Visual Studio Code](.readme/VSCode.png "Visual Studio Code")

Edit the `appsettings.Development.json` file, adding your Forge Client ID, Secret, emails for Application Admins, and your SQL Database connection string.

```json
{
  "ClientId": "your id here",
  "ClientSecret": "your secret here",
  "AdminEmails": "your admin user emails here",
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "SqlDB": "your sql server connection string here: e.g. Server=localhost;Database=RevitIFCScheduler;User=sa;Password=...;"
  }
}
```

Run the app. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the application.

### Tips and Tricks:

###### Sending Confirmation Emails

This tool uses SendGrid to send a confirmation email on a successful conversion. This requires creating a free SendGrid account (for up to 25,000 emails/month), verifying a 'Single Sender' email address, and retrieving an API Key with 'Send' authorization. Three optional environment settings must be set: `SendGridApiKey`, `FromEmail`, and `ToEmail`. If any one of these is left blank, no emails will be sent. 

SendGrid can be setup by creating an account at [www.sendgrid.com](https://www.sendgrid.com), or by creating a `SendGrid Accounts` resource from the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Sendgrid.sendgrid).

###### Internationalization - Additional Language Support

This application is capable of supporting multiple languages -- by default, English and Norwegian have been provided. To add additional languages, copy the folder located at `BIM360 - Revit to IFC Converter/ClientApp/public/locales/en`, and rename it with the appropriate language code. Search for the file named `i18next.ts`, and add the language code to the `fallbackLng` array. Finally, edit the `translation.json` and `scheduler.json` files in the folder that you just copied, and set the values on the right hand side to the appropriate translation.

When this is done, an additional language code will be shown in the header bar of the application.

###### Shallow Copies

When a file is 'shallow copied', and BIM 360 makes a reference to a file that's already claimed by another BIM360 file, it can't be processed via the Model Derivative service. This happens within 'Shared' folders, and when a user makes use of the 'copy' function. The `IncludeShallowCopies` optional environment setting allows us to get around this, by making a copy of the file on OSS, then translating that instead.

###### Modifying the Database

This tool uses Entity Framework Core in a code-first, migration based setup. Provide it with a connection  string, and it will automatically create or update the database and tables as needed.

When the tables are modified in the Data project, you will need to create a new Migration. Do do this, navigate to the 'BIM360 - Revit to IFC Converter' project, and run the following command: `dotnet ef migrations add NameOfYourMigrationHere`. The migration will be applied during the next application run.

### Troubleshooting

1. **Cannot see my BIM 360 projects**:
    * Make sure to provision the Forge App Client ID within the BIM 360 Account, [learn more here](https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/bim-360-docs-provisioning-forge-apps). (This requires the Account Admin permission)
    * Also, check **section 2.1 Login** and **section 2.3.1 Enabling a BIM360 account** of [UserGuide.pdf](UserGuide.pdf) for instructions.

2. **Received Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SqlException while starting this app**: if it indicates that `there is already an object named 'XXXXX' in the database`, then this means the database you specified in `appsetings.json` is not empty. You can fix it by doing either of the below ways:
    * Comment out the `dbContext.Database.Migrate();` in [Startup.cs](Startup.cs), then restart the app.
    * Backup your database, erase the database by executing `DROP DATABASE` command in the [SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15), and then restart the app.

3. **See 401 Unauthorized error after logging in**:
    * Check if the user level of the user account you logged in matches the listed roles of the  **section 2.1 Login** of [UserGuide.pdf](UserGuide.pdf).
    * If the user level of your user account is `Application Admins`, ensure that your user email is specified in the `AdminEmails` of the [App Settings Variables](#app-settings-variables).
